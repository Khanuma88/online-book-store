 # Online Book Store

## Project Proposal

### Project Idea & Purpose
Online Book Store is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React. The purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple and user-friendly platform to browse and explore books online. The application demonstrates the core concepts of React including components, JSX, and SPA architecture.

### Target Audience
The target audience includes students, book lovers, and online shoppers who prefer browsing books digitally. It is especially useful for university students searching for academic or fiction books.

### Problem the Application Solves
Many users visit multiple websites to find books and compare options. This application centralizes book browsing in one clean interface, providing a structured and organized experience.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
- Display a homepage
- Header, Main Content, and Footer components
- Basic layout with styling
- Organized project structure
- Functional React components

## SPA Theory Questions

### What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without reloading the entire page. Instead of requesting new pages from the server, the application updates only the necessary components using JavaScript. This provides a faster and smoother user experience.

### How does SPA differ from a traditional Multi-Page Application (MPA)?
In a Multi-Page Application (MPA), each user action requires loading a new HTML page from the server, which causes full page reloads. In contrast, a SPA updates the content dynamically without refreshing the page. SPAs offer better performance and a more app-like user experience.

### What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React uses it to compare changes between updates and efficiently update only the parts of the real DOM that have changed. This improves performance and makes rendering faster.

### Why does React use a component-based architecture?
React uses a component-based architecture to improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Each part of the interface is separated into independent components, making development easier and more structured.
